# Arduino Uno LED Bar Graph Display

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a simple LED bar graph display using an Arduino Uno. The number of LEDs illuminated represents a simulated sensor value, mapped to a visual bar graph on the LEDs.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **10 LEDs**
- **Resistors (220Ω - 1kΩ)**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect LEDs to Arduino Uno:**
   - Connect each LED's anode (long leg) to digital pins 2 through 11 on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect each LED's cathode (short leg) to a current-limiting resistor (220Ω - 1kΩ).
   - Connect the other end of the resistors to GND.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire up the LEDs and resistors according to the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - Observe the LED bar graph display, which will simulate a sensor value incrementally.

#### Applications

- **Visual Feedback:** Use for visualizing data such as sensor readings or system status.
- **Education:** Demonstrates basic Arduino programming and interfacing with LEDs.
- **Prototyping:** Easily adaptable for various projects needing visual representation.

#### Notes

- Ensure LEDs are correctly oriented and connected to the appropriate digital pins on the Arduino Uno.
- Adjust the code to map sensor values or other input data to the LED bar graph as per your project requirements.
- Experiment with different resistor values to adjust LED brightness and current consumption.
